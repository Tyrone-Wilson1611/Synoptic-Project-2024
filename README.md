To run your gonna have to install a few packages, i will list them here when i get the chance. "crypto-js": "^4.2.0",
        "http": "^0.0.1-security",
        "install": "^0.13.0",
        "node-fetch": "^3.0.0",
        "npm": "^10.8.1",
        "pg": "^8.11.5",
        "request": "^2.88.2",
        "simple-crypto-js": "^3.0.1",
        "typescript"


Also Database.mjs might not be necessary but it can be used to insert data into the database via the server end appliction rather than the DBMS, it should store the phone nums un the datbase encrypted and be ablt to decrypt when recieveing.
